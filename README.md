# Weather-Project

This web app displays the live weather🌥 data of any place you want to know!🤩. 

It is created by using Node.js and Express.js, so you have to install few npm packages.⚡
1. express
2. body-parser

The temperature is accessed by using the Open Weather Map API☁ ,which provides us with frequently updated weather. It is available for both free as well as paid subscriptions.💃
